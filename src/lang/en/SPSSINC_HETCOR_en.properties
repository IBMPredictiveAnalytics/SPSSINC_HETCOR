Description=This procedure calculates correlations between nominal, ordinal, and scale variables, accounting for the measurement levels of the variables. The resulting heterogeneous correlation matrix consists of Pearson product-moment correlations between scale variables, polyserial correlations between scale and categorical variables, and polychoric correlations between categorical variables. The procedure uses the hetcor function from the R polycor package.
Summary=Calculate correlations between nominal, ordinal, and scale variables.
